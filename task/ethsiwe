Sign-In with Ethereum is a new form of authentication that enables users to control their digital identity with their [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) account and [ENS](https://ens.domains) profile instead of relying on a traditional intermediary. Already used throughout Web3, this effort standardizes the method with best practices and makes it easy to adopt securely.
