# Adding a new wallet for authentication

> Link an additional wallet address to a Gnosis Pay user

A Gnosis Pay user can have multiple authenticated wallets attached to their account.\
Authenticated wallets are used to sign in via SIWE and to start new API sessions.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get a JWT token for the session">
    Follow the [authentication flow](https://docs.gnosispay.com/auth) to obtain a JWT token for the Gnosis Pay user.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a new wallet address">
    Make a POST call to [this endpoint](https://docs.gnosispay.com/api-reference/account-management/create-a-new-eoa-account-for-the-current-user) with the address to add.

    ```bash  theme={null}
    curl --request POST \
      --url https://api.gnosispay.com/api/v1/eoa-accounts \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
      --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --data '{
        "address": "0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678"
      }'
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify that the wallet was added">
    Call the [list accounts endpoint](https://docs.gnosispay.com/api-reference/account-management/retrieve-the-eoa-accounts-for-the-current-user).\
    The new address should appear in the response.

    ```bash  theme={null}
    curl --request GET \
      --url https://api.gnosispay.com/api/v1/eoa-accounts \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  * Adding an **authenticated wallet** only links it to a Gnosis Pay user for login and API sessions.
  * An authenticated wallet is **not automatically a Safe owner**.
  * Only Safe owners (EOAs or smart wallets added to the Safe) can interact with the Delay Module or execute on-chain actions.
  * Authenticated wallets can use the API (e.g. place card orders, fetch user info) but **cannot control funds** unless also added as Safe owners.
</Warning>
