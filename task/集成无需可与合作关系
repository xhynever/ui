# Integration models : Permissionless vs Partnerships

> Gnosis Pay offers two ways of integrating Gnosis Pay APIs. Whether you’re building as a developer or looking to launch a whitelisted branded solution, Gnosis Pay is designed to be flexible and accessible for all developers and businesses.

## Integration Models: Permissionless vs Partnerships

Gnosis Pay offers two ways to get started:

1. Permissionless Integration
2. Partnership Integration

***

## 1. Permissionless Integration (Free Plan Only)

Developers can start building with our APIs right away—no need to contact us or go through an approval process. This lets you quickly enable crypto payments, card issuance, and account features for your users.

<Info>
  This integration requires no special credentials. Simply authenticate with our APIs using SIWE (Sign-In with Ethereum) to receive a JWT token and start building.
</Info>

**Who it's for:** Developers or small teams who want to explore the APIs, prototype, or run very lightweight programs.

  <Card title="What You Can Do" icon="check" color="#16a34a">
    * ✅ Make API calls immediately — no API keys, approvals, or contracts
    * ✅ Issue and manage Gnosis-branded cards for testing and early users
    * ✅ Experiment with basic functionality (card issuance, transactions, balance queries)
  </Card>

  <Card title="What You Can't Do" icon="x" color="#dc2626">
    * ❌ Attribute card activity back to your business (no webhooks, no tracking)
    * ❌ Display sensitive card details (requires Partner Secure Element)
    * ❌ Launch a branded card program at scale
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Card title="🚀 When to Move On" icon="arrow-right" color="#2563eb">
  Once you want to connect card activity to your app/business or expose sensitive card details, you'll need to switch into Partnership mode.
